        <li> Virat Kohli, a name synonymous with cricketing prowess, passion, and perseverance, stands as an epitome of excellence in the realm of sports. Born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, Kohli's journey from a budding cricketer to one of the greatest batsmen of all time is a testament to his unyielding determination and unmatched talent.

            Then,In Malaysia's Under-19 World Cup, Virat led India to win and finished the competition as one of the top three run scorers. His innate leadership abilities attracted the proper kind of attention.After that he never looked back
        </li>
        <li>
            Virat received his maiden call-up to the Indian ODI team and participated in the entire five-match series against Sri Lanka on the road. In the fourth game of the series, he hit his first 50, a 54-run inning. When Virat got his first ODI century against Sri Lanka, 107 off 111, it was worth the wait for him to return to the national squad.  
        </li>
        <li>
            Virat participated in every game of India's victorious World Cup campaign in 2011, scoring his only century against Bangladesh in the opening match. Despite the fact that he didn't exactly light up the tournament with his bat, his final-round remark to Sachin has since become legendary in cricket: "Sachin Tendulkar has carried the weight of the nation for 21 years." Time for us to carry him on our shoulders.
        </li>
        <li>
            Every cricketer will answer "play Test cricket" when asked what their dream is. In 2011, Virat finally had the opportunity to play in his first Test match against the West Indies. Unfortunately for the charming lad, it was a forgettable experience as he scored just 19 runs in the two innings he played.In the fourth and final test against Australia in Adelaide, Kohli achieved his first test hundred under somewhat dramatic circumstances.  
        </li>
        <li>
            In place of an injured MS Dhoni, Virat was selected the stand-in ODI captain when India visited the West Indies. Earlier that year, he had also been named captain of his IPL team, the Royal Challengers Bangalore.When summoned to replace an ailing MS in Australia once more, Kohli experienced his first taste of Test captaincy. In Adelaide, he celebrated by scoring centuries in both innings. 
        </li>
        <li>
            As time goes on dhoni handed over the captaincy to virat on 4th january of 2017,virat bacame the full time captain in all the format,as we knoe when responsibility comes virat rises,exactly that happend he got his beast form through which got the name "Run Machine" and sizeable hundreds.in collection of all the century he got 70 hundreds which stands him in top 3 batsman of centuries.
        </li>
        <li>
            A best thing about a champion is he knows how to comeback from the worst phase.After covid-19 virat going through his worst form,not getting a single century in 2 years,facing trolls in social media,considering him as a failed captain everything made him to stepdown from the captaincy,and still his form is not improving but Rohit has trust on him ,he played virat every single game.After taking a break from cricket,he got himself back into the field and his form was also imroved and he got his most awaited 71st century against afganistan as well as his 1st t20 century and shut all mouth of the trollers.He is now just below the god of cricket Sachin Tendulkar in no of centuries.
        </li>
        <li>
            In this modern generation Kohli is known as a brand ambassador of cricket and he has the big role in making Bharat famous in world.Cricket is included in olympics due to the fan following,craze,popularity of virat.in short Virat Kohli is a blessing to cricket.
